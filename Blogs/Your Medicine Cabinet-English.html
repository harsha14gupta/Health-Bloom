                        <p>When it comes to first aid in the home, be prepared with a well-stocked medicine cabinet. If you need to treat an illness or injury, you will have all the common medications and first aid supplies on hand to help yourself or others.Before
                            you head to the drugstore, take an inventory of your medicine cabinet and what’s currently on your shelves. This is a good opportunity to clear your medicine cabinet of old prescriptions and expired medications. Make this a
                            habit and try to do this every three months. Remember: Always follow dosage instructions as indicated on medication packaging.<br></p>
                        <p><strong>10 common medicines and first aid supplies to have at home</strong><br><br>The following medicine cabinet supplies can treat a range of illnesses and minor injuries, from allergies and stomach aches to cut, bruises, aches
                            and pains.<br><br>1. Have a list of emergency instructions<br>Maintain a list of emergency phone numbers (doctors, Poison Control), medication instructions and allergy remedies inside the cabinet.<br><br>2. Acetaminophen and
                            an NSAID<br>Acetaminophen is a pain reliever and fever reducer. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce inflammation related to conditions like backaches and toothaches. Be aware of NSAID sensitivity in your
                            family, especially in young children.<br><br>3. Aspirin<br>Aspirin works as a pain reliever for adults, but it’s also important to have on hand in case of emergencies. According to the American Heart Association, taking aspirin
                            also helps during a heart attack. In fact, people having a heart attack are often given an aspirin by emergency medical services. However, it’s wise to be aware of aspirin sensitivity in your family, and it should never be
                            given to children under 18.<br><br>4. Antihistamine<br>Antihistamines treat hives, itching and allergic reactions from a wide range of causes. Stock both oral antihistamines (the liquid or pill form that may be helpful during
                            a serious allergic reaction) and hydrocortisone cream.<br><br>5. Decongestant, cough suppressant and flu relief medicine<br>You won’t want to leave home to go to the drugstore when you’re feeling lousy, so keep cold and flu
                            relief medication on hand.<br><br>6. Antacids<br>If you are suffering from heartburn, these are your best bet for quick relief.<br><br>7. Antibiotic ointment<br>Apply this after you’ve washed cuts and scrapes with warm water
                            and soap, then cover the wound with clean bandages.<br><br>8. Bandages<br>Stock up on adhesive bandages of all sizes, plus plenty of gauze and sterile tape.<br><br>9. Thermometer<br>Feeling someone’s forehead may be a good
                            first step, but a thermometer is necessary for an accurate temperature reading.<br><br>10. Heat and ice packs<br>Keep several of these on hand, as they can provide relief for everything from headaches and sprains to injuries
                            and sore muscles.<br></p>

                        <p><br>Here are the Benefits of having a medicine cabinet in your homes:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>1) To Give Necessary Aid Before Medical Help Arrives</strong><br>It is important you know that First Aid treatment is not supposed to completely
                            cure anyone who got an injury, accident or medical condition. Rather, it is to apply basic treatment to the victim before medical help arrives. Having a medicine cabinet or first aid kit is the first step to being prepared
                            for a medical emergency. However, make sure you check your medicine kit regularly, replace any item as soon as possible after you’ve used them.More importantly, check that everything is within its expiry date.<br><br><strong>2) Reduce infections</strong><br>Though
                            you cannot always keep your family from getting hurt but you can always protect them when they get injured. However, giving the necessary treatment from open wounds to injuries can reduce the severity. The content of your home’s
                            medicine kit could be a life-saver and can help reduce the risk of infection and the severity of an injury. Having a well-stocked Kit can make such a difference exactly when it counts.<br><br><strong>3) It can save lives</strong><br>This
                            is the most obvious reason for having a medicine cabinet. Having a kit at home gives you the confidence and ability to react immediately to an incident – injury or illness. More often than not, many lives have been saved due
                            to fast reaction and aid given during critical and life-threatening accidents, injuries or health complications.<br><br><strong>4) It can reduce recovery time</strong><br>Quick response to illness or injury before medical help
                            arrives does not only save lives, it can also reduce the recovery time of the victim.<br><br><strong>5) Prevent a severe injury from becoming a chronic problem</strong><br>One wrong step on the stairs or a collision in the
                            Kitchen can result in a sudden, painful injury. However, it is possible to limit the number and severity of injuries when this happens. You need to be prepared to act quickly and have access to a well-stocked cabinet. It will
                            help reduce the severity or damage of the injury.<br><br>6)&nbsp;<strong>Emergency Medical Supply within your home</strong><br>It is also an important source of emergency medical supplies. Regardless of the kind of medical
                            emergency that may arise in the home, you will always be able to counter it with the right medical supplies available in your medicine kit.<br><br>So, accidents can happen in homes anytime, but with a complete cabinet at your
                            disposal, you can ensure that any future accidents will be appropriately tended to. As important as they are, all homes should endeavor to have them and also make them easily accessible to everyone in the home. In all, when
                            in doubt about adding a medicine cabinet to your homes, remember that it’s always better to have something and never need it, than to need it and not have it on hand.<br></p>
